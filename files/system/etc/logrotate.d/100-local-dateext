# see "man logrotate" for details

# Archive old versions of log files adding a daily extension like YYYYMMDD
dateext

# Use yesterday's instead of today's date to create the dateext (YYYYMMDD)
# extension, so that the rotated log file has a date in its name that is
# the same as the timestamps within it.
